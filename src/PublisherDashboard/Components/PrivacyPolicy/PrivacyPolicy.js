                                    same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.</p>
                                <p>Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and

                                    to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose equivalent data protection obligations directly on the recipient unless we are permitted under

                                    (for example certain transaction details and correspondence may be retained until the time limit for claims in respect of the transaction has expired or in order
                                    to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data). So if information is used for two purposes we will retain it until the purpose with
                                    the latest period expires, but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter period one that period expires. </p>

                                <p>We restrict access to your personal information to those persons who need to use it for the relevant purpose(s). Our retention periods are based on business needs
                                    and your information that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymized (and the anonymized information may be retained) or securely destroyed.</p>

                                    or if the identity of the requestor cannot be verified. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated, and may seek additional information to allow us to
                                    understand your request.</p>

                                <p>You have a right to be informed about the processing of your personal data (and if you did not give it to us, information as to the source) and this Privacy Policy
                                    intends to provide such information. Of course, if you have any further questions you can contact us on the above details.</p>

                                <h6>Right of access</h6>
                                <p>You have a right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not your personal data are being processed and, where this is the case, a right of access to your

                                    we follow strict storage and disclosure procedures, which means that we will require proof of identity from you prior to disclosing such information. This is a
                                    security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>

                                <h6>Right to rectification</h6>
                                <p>You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data rectified and to have any incomplete personal information about you completed.</p>
                                <p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship
                                    with us. If we do hold personal data and you believe it is incorrect, you may submit a request to us to correct any alleged mistakes.</p>
                                <p>We shall communicate any rectification of personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves
                                    disproportionate effort, and shall inform you about such recipients if you request it.</p>

                                <h6>Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)</h6>
                                <p>You have the general right to request the erasure of your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected;</li>
                                    <li>You withdraw your consent to consent based processing and no other legal justification for processing applies;</li>

                                    <li>We unlawfully processed your personal information; and/or</li>
                                    <li>Erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is necessary for:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>

                                    <li>Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, under certain circumstances; and/or</li>
                                    <li>The establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We shall communicate any erasure of personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves
                                    disproportionate effort, and shall inform you about such recipients if you request it.</p>

                                <h6>Right to restrict processing</h6>
                                <p>Instead of requesting erasure, you also have the right to right to restrict processing of your personal information where:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You contest the accuracy of the personal information;</li>
                                    <li>Processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
                                    <li>We no longer need to process your personal information but you need us to retain your information as you need it for the establishment, exercise, or
                                        defence of legal claims; or</li>
                                    <li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We shall communicate any restriction of personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves
                                    disproportionate effort, and shall inform you about such recipients if you request it.</p>

                                <h6>Right to object to processing</h6>
                                <p>You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent;</li>
                                    <li>Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to
                                        object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms; or</li>
                                    <li>Where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes</li>

                                <p>Exercise of this right may impact the services we can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise it. In some cases, we may demonstrate
                                    that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms, and this may allow us to continue to
                                    (wholly or partly) process your personal information.</p>

                                <h6>Right to data portability</h6>

                                    <li>The performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in a controller; or</li>

                                <p>We do not process personal data on grounds of public interest or exercise of official authority. We do however rely on our legitimate interests as a lawful basis for

                                    change our right to contact you regarding your use of our website or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.</p>

                                    affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products
